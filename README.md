# Quill

An ML algorithm for author attribution based on dialogue. A CS 221 project.

## Technologies Used

### Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning

- **Python:** Main programming language.
- **Transformers:** To leverage pre-trained models like DistilBert for NLP tasks.
- **Torch:** To utilize frameworks for deep learning models and tensor operations.
- **Accelerate:** To accelerate training on different hardware configurations.
- **Evaluate:** To use model evaluations and metric calculations.

### Data Handling & Visualization

- **Matplotlib:** To generate visualizations of training and validation loss.
- **Tqdm:** To provide progress bars during model training loops.
- **Scikit-Learn:** To provide tools for data splitting, model evaluation, and accuracy metrics.

## Background

This project leverages DistilBERT, a lighter and faster version of the BERT model. My main goal is to attribute authorship to dialogues from the Star Wars saga, distinguishing between different characters across Episodes IV to VI.

The motivation behind this project stems from the broader context of digital text authorship verification and plagiarism detection. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model on scripts, this research explores a specific, yet important, application of ML to problems traditionally confined to literary and academic texts.
